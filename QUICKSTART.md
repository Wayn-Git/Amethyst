# 🚀 AMETHYST Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **AMETHYST** (Personal Operating System with Knowledge)! This guide will get you up and running in **less than 2 minutes**.

---

## ⚡ 1-Minute Automated Start (Recommended)

AMETHYST includes automated startup scripts:
- **macOS / Linux / WSL2**: Run `./run.sh`
- **Windows**: Run `run.bat` *(in Command Prompt or PowerShell, or double-click it)*

*(Note: If your operating system hides file extensions, `run.sh` and `run.bat` may both appear simply as `run`. Choose `run.bat` for Windows and `run.sh` for Unix/Mac/Linux).*

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Wayn-Git/Amethyst.git
cd Amethyst

# 2. Run the startup script (macOS/Linux/WSL)
./run.sh

# Or on Windows:
run.bat
```

The script automatically sets up `.venv`, installs dependencies, initializes the database, builds the frontend, and opens the app in your browser at:
👉 **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Interactive Setup Wizard (API Keys, OAuth & Connectors)

If you or a friend want a guided interactive setup for your AI models, app connectors (Google, Microsoft, GitHub), Cloudflare embeddings, and the Library:

```bash
./run.sh --setup
# Or on Windows:
run.bat --setup
```

For detailed manual instructions for every integration, see the **[Complete Configuration & Connectivity Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)**.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running, ensure your machine has:
- **Python 3.11+** (`python3 --version`)
- **Node.js 18+** & **npm** (`node -v && npm -v`)

## 🐳 Option 2: Docker Compose

If you have Docker installed, you don't need Python or Node on your host:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**. Your data is stored locally in `./data/amethyst`.

---

## 🛠️ Option 3: Manual Installation

If you prefer installing step-by-step:

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Start everything
amethyst serve --open
```

`amethyst serve` is the whole thing. It prepares the database on first run,
builds the web interface if there is not one yet, and starts every background
service — automations, reminders, the journal, both job lanes, the relay poll,
the browser watcher and your MCP connectors — inside the one process. It then
prints which optional pieces are configured and which are not, so a phone that
will not pair tells you the relay is missing rather than leaving you guessing.

Useful variations: `--no-build` skips the interface build, `--rebuild` forces
one, `--port 8001` moves it, `--reload` restarts it on source changes, and
`--host 127.0.0.1` keeps it off the LAN. For the Vite dev server alongside the
API, use `./run.sh --dev`.

## 🧠 Setting Up AI Models (2 Minutes)

AMETHYST works with **100% free local models** as well as **cloud providers** (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Groq, Gemini).

### Method A: 100% Free & Local (Ollama - No API Keys)
1. Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).
2. Pull any model (for example, Llama 3.2 or Qwen 2.5):
   ```bash
   ollama run llama3.2
   ```
3. AMETHYST connects to Ollama automatically! Simply pick it from the model selector in the chat.

### Method B: Cloud Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq)
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (the startup script does this automatically):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Add your API key(s) to `.env`:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
```
*Or* configure them via the web UI in **Settings → Models**, or via the CLI:
```bash
amethyst secrets set amethyst/anthropic
amethyst secrets set amethyst/openai
amethyst secrets set amethyst/groq
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: Why do I see two `run` files in the repository root?
There is **`run.sh`** (for macOS, Linux, and WSL2) and **`run.bat`** (for Windows Command Prompt / PowerShell). If your file explorer has "Hide extensions for known file types" turned on, they might both display as "run". Run `run.bat` on Windows and `./run.sh` on Mac/Linux.

### Q: How do I configure OAuth (Google Workspace, Microsoft To Do, etc.)?
1. **Microsoft To Do**: Zero configuration! Click **Add** → **Connect** in **Connectors & Skills** (`/capabilities`) and approve with your Microsoft account via device code.
2. **Google Workspace**: Create an OAuth desktop client in Google Cloud Console, add the Client ID/Secret in `.env` or run `./run.sh --setup`, then click **Connect**.
See [docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md](docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Q: How does the Cloudflare Worker Relay work for Instagram and Library capture?
The relay in `relay/` is a free Cloudflare Worker that stays awake on the edge. When you or someone else sends/comments a reel on Instagram or shares a link from a phone, the relay holds it until your machine pulls it, transcribes the audio, and saves it into your Library. See [docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md#4-cloudflare-worker-relay](docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md#4-cloudflare-worker-relay).

### Q: The page is blank when opening http://127.0.0.1:8000?
Run `./run.sh --build` (or `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`). AMETHYST serves the SPA from `frontend/dist`.

### Q: How do I test if everything is functioning?
Run `./run.sh --doctor` or `run.bat --doctor`. It validates the database, model providers, tools, and skills.

### Q: Can I run frontend and backend separately with live hot-reloading?
Yes! Simply run:
```bash
./run.sh --dev
```
This starts the backend on port `8000` and the Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## 📱 Using Amethyst From Your Phone

Your computer keeps your files and runs your work. Your phone attaches to it,
watches what it publishes, and can send it more. Everything between the two is
sealed — the relay carrying it cannot read any of it.

**On your computer:** open **Settings → Devices** and press **Pair a device**.
A QR code appears, good for five minutes, once.

**On your phone:** open Amethyst and point the camera at the code. That is the
whole flow — the code carries the relay address as well as the secret, so there
is nothing to type and nothing to configure.

Two things make this smoother if you set them up:

- **A relay.** Pairing completes through it, so without one nothing can answer
  your phone. `amethyst serve` says so at startup if it is missing. See
  [relay/README.md](relay/README.md).
- **Where your phone opens Amethyst** (Settings → Devices). Set this and the QR
  code becomes an ordinary `https` link that your phone's own camera app opens
  by itself. Leave it blank and the code still works — it just has to be scanned
  from the pairing screen inside the app.

To disconnect a phone, press **Revoke** beside it. Anything it had queued is
cancelled in the same breath, and it stops being recognised within one poll.
Pair it again the same way.

> Opening Amethyst on a phone always shows the pairing screen or the remote
> control, never the desktop interface — that layout needs a screen a phone does
> not have. If you want it anyway, add `?desktop=1` to the address.

## 🗺️ Your First Five Minutes

Now that the app is open at http://127.0.0.1:8000, here is the fastest path to a useful answer:

1. **Pick a model** — the model selector beside the composer lists every configured provider. Ollama models appear automatically if Ollama is running.
2. **Send one line** — try `summarise ~/Documents` or `what meetings do I have this week?`. The agent decides which tools to use.
3. **Approve carefully** — anything that writes or runs asks first, naming the *operation* (`write_file`, `run_shell_command:read-only`), not just the tool. Approving a read-only command never approves a destructive one.
4. **Press `?`** — every keyboard binding in the app, one screen.
5. **Turn on beta pages** — Settings (`⌘,`) → **Beta pages** adds Mail and Automations to the rail.

### Q: `Error: address already in use` or the port is taken?
Another AMETHYST (or something else) is on port 8000:
```bash
./run.sh --port 8001
```
Or stop the old one first (`Ctrl+C` in its terminal).

### Q: The model replies "not configured" or no provider appears?
- Ollama: check it is running (`curl http://127.0.0.1:11434`) and you pulled a model (`ollama run llama3.2`).
- Cloud: the key did not reach the process — keys in `.env` are read at start, so restart after editing. `amethyst doctor` says exactly which providers are up.

### Q: The turn just stopped — is that a bug?
A permission prompt suspends the turn until answered; check for an amber prompt above the composer, or another conversation holding it (announced as a line above the transcript). `Escape` denies, `Enter` allows, `R` arms "remember this decision".

## 🚀 New Features

### Enterprise-Grade Reliability

Amethyst's backend is fortified against edge cases, resource leaks, and concurrency issues:
- **One instance, guaranteed** — `amethyst serve` asks the port before it binds and hands you the URL of the server that is already running instead of starting a second one against the same SQLite file.
- **Leak-free streaming** — FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` guarantee cleanup of SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections, preventing memory leaks when clients disconnect ungracefully.
- **Orphan process prevention** — Explicit process group reaping ensures that background PTY processes spawned by the terminal manager are killed instantly on shutdown.
- **Strict dependency isolation** — Dynamic skill loading employs robust directory existence validation and YAML mapping verification, preventing malformed skills from crashing the system.

### Premium UI/UX & Motion Design

The interface is built to look and feel stunning:
- **Glassmorphism & Glow** — Soft gradients, blurred backdrops (`backdrop-filter`), and dynamic drop-shadows bring the interface to life.
- **Fluid Motion** — Smooth page transitions (`view-swap`), slide-in sidebars, and refined popover animations make interactions feel purposeful and fast.
- **Responsive Empty States** — Skeleton loaders and carefully crafted empty views provide a polished experience even when there is no data to show.
- **Robust Error Boundaries** — Graceful fallbacks and toast notifications catch unhandled promise rejections and backend warnings without breaking the flow.
