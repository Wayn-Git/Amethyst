#: What answers a caller that is not this machine.
#:
#: ADR-0011 declined to build authentication because the boundary was the
#: operating system's own user account, and `serve` binds to loopback so that
#: held. Then `--host 0.0.0.0` printed a warning and published the lot -- and
#: the reason people pass it is the ordinary one: they want to open Amethyst on
#: their phone. So the warning was aimed at exactly the person with a good
#: reason to ignore it, and what they got for it was a shell, their files and
#: their mail on the local network.
#:
#: This is the smallest thing that makes that bind survivable. From anywhere but
#: this machine, only these answer:
#:
#:   - the built interface, which is static files and the point of binding wide
#:   - `/api/ping`, which the interface uses to decide whether a backend exists
#:     and which says nothing but that one
#:   - `/api/pair/claim`, the pairing handshake -- unauthenticated by necessity,
#:     because a device with no credential is what it exists to give one to, and
#:     safe for the same reason the relay's `/pair` is: the 160-bit secret from
#:     the QR code is the only thing that opens it
#:
#: Everything else is 403. Not 404: pretending the route does not exist would
#: make a misconfiguration look like a bug in the client.
#:
#: **This does nothing behind a reverse proxy**, where every request arrives
#: from loopback. That is the deployment `docs/deployment.md` describes, and the
#: proxy is where authentication belongs in it. This defends the case the proxy
#: is not there for: somebody on their own network, with no proxy, who wanted
#: their phone to reach this.
