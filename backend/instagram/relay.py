"""Taking what the relay caught while this machine was off.

`docs/archive/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-instagram-relay-design.md` has the
why. The short version: a closed laptop is a *down* webhook endpoint, and Meta
responds to a down endpoint by retrying and then disabling the subscription.
So a small always-on Worker answers Meta's 200 and holds the delivery in a free
SQLite queue, and this module is the half that goes and gets it.

**The relay is always on and it is never trusted.** It stores the exact bytes
Meta sent and the exact `X-Hub-Signature-256` header, and `_accept` verifies that
signature again here before a single row reaches `InstagramEventStore`. A
compromised Worker can lose a reel; it cannot invent one. That is the whole
reason the raw bytes are relayed rather than a tidy parsed object -- a parsed
object cannot be checked.

One thing is deliberately *not* re-checked: `signature.is_stale`. A delivery that
sat at the relay for two days is exactly what this feature is for, and the skew
window exists to stop a captured body being replayed. Replay is already
impossible twice over -- the relay's `body_hash` is UNIQUE and
`instagram_events.delivery_key` is UNIQUE -- so applying a fifteen-minute clock
to a queue built to survive a weekend would silently discard everything it caught.
