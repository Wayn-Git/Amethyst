"""The drain.

A fourth runner beside automations, reminders and the journal, and for the same
stated reason each of those is separate: the work here is minutes long -- a
download, ffmpeg, a transcription, a model call -- and queueing a reminder or a
briefing behind it would make neither arrive when it should.

It waits on an event with a timeout rather than sleeping on a fixed tick. The
nudge is what matters: a delivery is acknowledged and drained within
microseconds, which is the difference between fetching a `lookaside` asset that
still exists and one that has expired. The timeout is what makes it durable --
a queue left behind by a crash is picked up on the next tick regardless of
whether anything nudges.
