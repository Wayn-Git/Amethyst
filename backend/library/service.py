"""The library: what you read, watched and listened to, and how to find it again.

One service, three thin callers -- the HTTP routes, the agent tools, and the
share endpoint -- following `backend/tasks/service.py`. The callers translate
arguments in and phrase results out; the decisions live here.

**The text is a real file.** AMETHYST stores an index that points at the filesystem
and treats the file as the source of truth (ADR-0004), so a captured article is
written to `~/.amethyst/library/{id}-{slug}.md` and indexed by the ordinary
`Indexer`. Nothing about search had to be taught the library exists: a saved
article is found by `search_documents` exactly as a vault note is, ranked by the
same hybrid index, and the user can open the file.

**A capture that goes wrong still logs the item.** A paywall, a 403, a video
with no transcript, an embedder that is not running -- each of those loses some
of what the item could have been, and none of them should lose the fact that you
read it. Every partial outcome writes `capture_note` saying which one happened,
because an item with no text and no explanation is indistinguishable from a bug.
