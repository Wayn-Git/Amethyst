-- The relay's whole database. Two tables, and both are deliberately small.

-- transience is why this fits in a free tier and why the blast radius of the
-- relay being compromised is one delivery rather than a library.

-- cannot be reopened. This is the record that a send was owed, so the Workflow
-- in src/ack.ts can keep trying and the laptop can see what happened while it
-- was away.

-- re-delivering therefore does not buy a second ack, for the same reason it does

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- the jobs
--
-- The generic half. `deliveries` above is a *transport* -- Meta's exact bytes,
-- held until the laptop verifies them -- and it stays that way because a parsed
-- delivery cannot be checked against a signature. This table is the other
-- thing: work the relay was asked to *do* while the laptop was away, of a kind
-- named by `kind` rather than built into the Worker.
--
-- The shape is deliberately `backend/jobs/`'s: an idempotency key that decides
-- what "the same job" is, a bounded attempt count, a step ledger, and a result
-- small enough to live in a row. Two halves of one idea rather than two ideas.
--
-- What is NOT here: content. A job's result carries references -- a URL, a
-- title, an R2 key when there genuinely are bytes -- and the bytes are deleted
-- the moment the laptop confirms it has them. Cloud retention is a queue's
-- worth, not a library's.

-- and half the time there is no laptop -- so it reports here and the laptop
-- collects on the /sync poll it was already making.
--
-- Deliberately NOT the `jobs` table. A job there is work *this relay runs*: the
-- sweep re-dispatches it, `promoteDue` promotes it out of backoff, a Workflow
-- instance executes its steps. A worker report is none of those things -- there
-- is nothing here to run -- and parking rows in `jobs` to use it as storage
-- would mean the sweep periodically trying to execute a mailbox.
--
-- `job_id` is chosen by the laptop before dispatch, because `workflow_dispatch`
-- returns no run id: the only name both sides share is the one we picked.
--
-- Transient, like everything else here. A row lives until the laptop confirms
-- it, and the daily cron clears whatever nobody came back for.

--

--
-- Everything else in this file is plaintext because the relay has to *act* on
-- it: it answers Meta's webhook, it runs a `url_ingest`, it decides whether the
-- laptop is away. An op needs none of that. It is carried from one of the user's
-- devices to another and never inspected, so there is no reason for this table
-- to hold anything but sealed bytes -- and every reason not to, since these are
-- the user's settings and task titles rather than a public reel.
--
-- `op_id` and `from_device` are in the clear because routing needs them: one is
-- the duplicate guard, the other says who must NOT be sent it back. Both are
-- opaque identifiers. The AEAD binds the ciphertext to both, so moving a
-- ciphertext onto another row yields a decryption failure on the far side
-- rather than a plausible op attributed to the wrong device.
