/**
 * Running one job's steps, exactly once each, however many attempts it takes.
 *
 * Deliberately free of `cloudflare:workers`: it takes a `StepLike`, which is
 * what `WorkflowStep` already is and what a test can be. The Workflow class in
 * `workflow.ts` is four lines because of that, and everything worth asserting
 * about retries, idempotency and state transitions can be asserted without a
 * workerd instance.
 *
 * Two layers of idempotency, and they guard different failures:
 *
 *   - `step.do` -- Workflows' own. A step that already returned inside *this*
 *     instance is not re-run when a later step fails.
 *   - `job_steps` -- ours, in D1. A step that already returned is not re-run
 *     when the *instance itself* is lost and the sweep dispatches a new one.
 *
 * The second is the one that matters here, because a Worker eviction, a deploy
 * or a D1 blip all end an instance without ending the job.
