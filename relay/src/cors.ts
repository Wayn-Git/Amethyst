/**
 * The routes a *browser* calls, and the headers that let it.
 *
 * This relay had no CORS at all, and that quietly made the phone companion
 * impossible in the shape it was designed for. A control device is a browser
 * loading the interface from wherever it is hosted -- Pages, Vercel, a tunnel --
 * and then calling `/pair` and `/ops` here. That is cross-origin every time, so
 * without these headers the browser refuses the request before it leaves and
 * the phone reports being offline while sitting on full signal.
 *
 * It went unnoticed because nothing that exercised this path was a browser:
 * the tests are Python and Node, neither of which has a same-origin policy, and
 * the machine's own interface is same-origin with the API it talks to.
 *
 * `*`, and deliberately without `Allow-Credentials`. The origin is not the
 * security boundary on either route and cannot be: `/pair` is unauthenticated
 * by design -- the 160-bit secret in the QR code is what makes an offer real --
 * and `/ops` takes a bearer token in a header. A hostile page can already reach
 * both with curl; what it cannot do is produce that AEAD tag or hold that
 * token. Pinning an origin list here would mean redeploying the Worker every
 * time somebody moves their frontend, for nothing gained.
 *
 * Its own module so it can be tested. `src/index.ts` imports
 * `cloudflare:workers` for the Workflow binding, which node cannot resolve, so
 * anything only reachable through the fetch handler is only reachable with
 * workerd -- and this rule is small enough that it should not need one.

/** Routes a browser may call cross-origin.
 *  `/sync` is the machine, `/ig/webhook` is Meta — neither is a browser.
 *  `/share` is a phone Shortcut or a browser share-target sending a link.

 *  Both carry bearer tokens, not cookies, so `*` is safe. */
