/**
 * The sync mailbox: sealed bytes in, sealed bytes out, nothing understood.
 *
 * This is the third mailbox in this Worker and the simplest, because it is the
 * only one whose contents the relay has no business reading. `deliveries` holds
 * Meta's exact bytes so the laptop can re-verify a signature; `worker_reports`
 * holds a result the laptop re-validates. Both are plaintext because something
 * downstream needs to parse them. An op is carried between two of one person's
 * own devices, so it arrives sealed and leaves sealed, and the strongest
 * statement this file can make is that it could not read one if it tried.
 *
 * Fan-out is why `op_acks` exists rather than a `synced_at` column. A delivery
 * has exactly one taker, so "taken" is a property of the row. An op has as many
 * takers as the user has devices, and deleting on first collection would lose it
 * for the second. So the row survives until every registered device but the
 * sender has acked, and the daily cron clears whatever nobody came back for --
 * a device that is never coming back must not pin a row forever.
